# Specs

This repo maintains rfcs and definitions for Beyond Storage.

## RFC Process
- (Optional) Submit an issue in `beyondstorage/specs` or [forum](https://forum.beyondstorage.io/) as a pre-proposal to discuss the idea.
- Copy `rfcs/0-example.md` to `rfcs/0-my-feature.md` (where "my-feature" is descriptive). Don't assign an RFC number yet; This is going to be the PR number.
- Fill in the RFC.
- Submit a pull request. Use the issue number of the PR to update the filename.
- If at least 2 reviewers approve the RFC, it is accepted.
- Before an accepted RFC gets merged, a tracking issue should be opened in corresponding repo, and the RFC metadata should be updated. If the author doesn't do so in time, a maintainer can help complete it and then merge the PR.
